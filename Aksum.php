		Aksum (also spelt Axum) stands at the epicenter of Ethiopian history. In ancient times, it served as the economic hub of the Aksumite Empire, which lasted for some nine hundred years from the second to the tenth centuries, and as the capital of a ruling dynasty legendarily descended from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.<br> It is also the cradle and spiritual home of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which was established here during the fourth-century reign of King Ezana. Somewhat more tenuous is the Ethiopian claim that the original biblical Ark of the Covenant is protected in Maryam Tsion, Aksum’s most venerable church.<br> Aksum is studded with some extraordinary antiquities, including the tallest stelae (obelisks) ever erected by the ancients, and engraved trilingual tablets dating to the time of Christ – all of which can be hugely rewarding when approached with realistic expectations.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#jugol">Click Here To Read More About Harar Jugol</a>

	<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 150%;padding-left: 33px;text-align:45%;line-height: 33px;">
		In an expansive field on Aksum’s northern edge stand the ancient city’s most renowned surviving monuments, a group of a group of memorial or stelae erected between the third and fourth centuries A.D.<br> Although other Aksumite stelae fields such as the Gudit field are known, none possess the great variety of form and scale present here, ranging from relatively rough-hewn stone blocks of three feet in length to a now fallen tour de force intended to tower 97 feet high.<br> The stelae were carved mainly from solid blocks of nepheline syenite, a weather-resistant rock similar in appearance to granite, and are believed to have come from the quarries of Wuchate Golo several miles to the west of Aksum.<br> After being cut from the rock walls there, they would have been dragged by organized manpower to the site of their installation, where finer carving awaited a few of the stelae.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#jugol">Click Here To Read More About Harar Jugol</a> <br>The impetus for this organizational effort appears to have been commemorative: there are many burials in this area and elaborate tombs are situated near the foremost group of the largest stelae. The wide variation in size and carving sophistication is most likely due to the varying degrees of social status and wealth of the deceased.<br> Although the identities of the persons who sponsored them are not known, the tallest stelae probably commemorated royalty while smaller works were most likely commissioned by local elite.

		Of the seven tallest stelae, originally forming a group, five lay in ruins across the field. These stelae are significant not only for their great stature but also their extraordinary design, as they have been carved to represent buildings of up to 13 stories in height. Although actual Aksumite buildings probably never exceeded a maximum of three stories, many details on the obelisks are regarded as accurate representations of the architecture of the time.<br> Representative stone doors carved at the feet of the stelae simulate wood ones, some even incised with locks. Further up the monoliths, false four-holed windows have been hewn into the rock.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#jugol">Click Here To Read More About Harar Jugol</a><br> Timber, once widely used for structural support in Aksumite buildings, is recalled by the false square beam-ends that project as if serving a functional purpose through the stelae “walls.” Some of these architectural illusions also appear on the nearby rock tombs, notably those that have come to be known as the “Mausoleum” and the “Tomb of the false door.” <br>The stelae terminate in rounded peaks marked with fixing holes that once held nails, possibly intended to fasten symbolic icons. Some of the stelae also possess stone base plates depicting a two-handled Greek wine cup known as a kylix.<br> Although it is well known that Greek cultural influences through trade were important at Aksum,

		where money was minted and inscriptions written in Greek, the significance of these plates has yet to be determined.
Raised during the late fourth century, this group of seven stelae was erected around the same time that Aksum’s court adopted Christianity, a time of tremendous change in Aksumite culture.<br> One scholar has suggested that the apparent failure to erect the largest stelae, which evidently cracked and fell as it was being installed, may have accelerated adoption of the new religion. Whether or not this is the case, these stelae were the last of such a scale to have been dedicated to Aksum.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#jugol">Click Here To Read More About Harar Jugol</a>

	<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 150%;padding-left: 33px;text-align:45%;line-height: 33px;">
		The Harar Jugol Wall is believed to have been built between the 13th and 16th centuries. The Harar Jugol Wall originally had five historic gates providing five entries into five different districts of the city. The wall was built as a defense in medieval times, an imposing 5m high and 3.5km long.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#aksum">Click Here To Read More About The Monument Of Aksum</a><br> The old town is surrounded by this fascinating wall with the famous gates, Shoa Gate, Buda Gate, Erer Gate, Sanga Gate and Fallana Gate. In 1889 a sixth gate, Harar gate, was added by Ras Makonnen, the first duke of Harar.<br>
The African and Islamic traditions influenced over a long period of time the development of the city and its typical urban planning and contributed to its particular character and uniqueness.<br> The present urban layout follows the 16th century design for an Islamic town with its central core occupied with commercial and religious buildings and a maze of narrow alleyways with imposing facades.

		Modern Harar surrounds the old capital, which is Ethiopia’s only walled city. The ancient walls enclose a crowded Muslim town with alleyways that wind to a central marketplace. Outside the walls, the city spreads across the plateau and is characterized by northern Ethiopian and European architecture.<br> Because of ritual differences in slaughtering, separate Muslim and Christian marketplaces are maintained.
The city of Harar is located on a hilltop in the eastern extension of the Ethiopian Highlands, about five hundred kilometers from the capital Addis Ababa.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#aksum">Click Here To Read More About The Monument Of Aksum</a><br> The population includes the local Harari (Adere), who speak a Semitic language and have literature written in Arabic script, as well as the Amhara, Oromo, and Somalis....

		Most notably, Harar city is known for its Jugol wall and the walled gates that are believed to be built somewhere between the 13th and 16th century. This thick, 5 m high and 3.5 km long Jugol wall was built as a defensive response to the people of the city in the medieval times.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#aksum">Click Here To Read More About The Monument Of Aksum</a>
