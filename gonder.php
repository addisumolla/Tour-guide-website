		Fasil Ghebbi is located in the Amhara National Regional State, in North Gondar Administrative Zone of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.<br> The serial property consists of eight components.

		Between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, Ethiopian rulers moved their royal camps frequently. King Fasil (Fasilidas) settled in Gondar and established it as a permanent capital in 1636.<br> Before its decline in the late eighteenth century, the royal court had developed from a camp into a fortified compound called Fasil Ghebbi, consisting of six major building complexes and other ancillary buildings, surrounded by a wall 900 meters long, with twelve entrances and three bridges.<a href="#semen">semein mountain national park</a>

		The fortress city functioned as the center of the Ethiopian government until 1864. It has some twenty palaces, royal buildings, highly decorated churches, monasteries and unique public and private buildings, transformed by the Baroque style brought to Gondar by the Jesuit missionaries.<br> The main castle has huge towers and looming battlemented walls, resembling a piece of medieval Europe transposed to Ethiopia. Beyond the confines of the city to the north-west by the Qaha River, there is a two-story pavilion of a bathing palace associated to Emperor Fasilidas.<br> The building is a two-story battlemented structure situated within and on one side of a rectangular pool of water which was supplied by a canal from the nearby river. The bathing pavilion itself stands on pier arches, and contains several rooms reached by a stone bridge, part of which could be raised for defense. Subsequent rulers, such as Iyasu the Great, continued building, improving the techniques and architectural style and expanded to the hills north-west of the city center, in the area known as Qusquam.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#semen">semein mountain national park</a><br>
Fasil Ghebbi and the other remains in Gondar city demonstrate a remarkable interface between internal and external cultures, with cultural elements related to Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Ethiopian Jews and Muslims.<br> This relationship is expressed not only through the architecture of the sites but also through the handicrafts, painting, literature and music that flourished in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<a href="#semen">semein mountain national park</a>

	<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 150%;padding-left: 33px;text-align:45%;line-height: 33px;">
		It was built by Emperor Fasiladas who, after growing bored with the migratory semi-nomadic lifestyle of his predecessors, decided to make a statement by building a grandiose palace complex - one of the most magnificent structures of its time.

		Simien Mountains National Park is located in the northern region of Ethiopia. The national park encompasses an area of 85 square miles (220 sq km).
The Simien Mountains are part of the Ethiopian Highlands.<br>  The mountains are comprised of plateaus that are split by valleys and pinnacles.  Ras Dashn is the tallest mountain in Ethiopia reaching a summit of 14,930 feet (4,550 m).<br> 
The Ras Dashn Mountain is the 10th tallest mountain in Africa.  The western summit of the mountain provides an enclosed observation deck.  It is a 360 deck offering visitors a panoramic view of the spectacular mountainous landscape.
The landscape across the plateau features jagged peaks, ridges, meadows, deep valleys, alpine forests, and steep precipices.<br>  An unpaved road meanders across the park up to Buahit Pass at 14,534 feet (4,430 m).
Predator species include leopard, caracal, hyena, jackal, wild cat, and the rare Ethiopian wolf.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#fasil">Click Here To Read More About The Castle Of Fasiledes</a> <br> Other popular species include bushbuck, common duiker, klipspringer, hamadryas baboon, and the rare gelada baboon.  The endangered Walia ibex is a wild goat found only in this region.

	<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 157%;padding-left: 33px;text-align:45%;line-height: 33px;">
		There are around 400 species of birds with the lanner falcon, kestrels, and Verreaux’s eagle being some of the sought-after predators.  Of the 400 species, 63 species are endemic.
The Park is of global significance for its biodiversity and endemism. It is home to many species and habitats that exist nowhere else. 80% of the areas over 3000m in Africa are in Ethiopia, and much of this is within the Simien Mountains.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#fasil">Click here To Read More About The Castle Of Fasiledes</a> <br>
Although numbers vary depending on who you listen to, it’s believed that over 20 large mammals and 130-200 bird species live in the park. As you trek across the Simiens, you'll encounter the endangered Walia Ibex, the Ethiopian Wolf (or Simien Fox) which is the rarest canid species in the world and the rather wonderful Gelada Monkey (often called the Gelada Baboon, but not technically a baboon!).<br> 
The Simiens was one of the first places to be given the title of a World Heritage Site in 1978. In 1996, it made it onto the less desirable World Heritage in Danger list, due to the decline in the population of Walia Ibex as a result of human settlement, grazing, roads and other influences.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#fasil">Click Here To Read More About The Castle Of Fasiledes</a><br>

By far the most famous of all the wildlife in the Simiens, Gelada Monkeys are found in abundance in the Simien Mountains. With numbers estimated at over 5000, you’re all but guaranteed to bump into troops of these amazing animals on any Simien trip. They’re easy-going and likely to be the most photographed creatures you’ll encounter as they are fairly tame and peaceful.

		They have a distinct, hourglass shaped patch over their chests, which has led to their common name, the ‘bleeding heart monkey’. Geladas are endemic to the Simien Mountains and live at elevations of 1800-4400m, sleeping in cliffs and the patrolling the grasslands for food - grasses, seeds, roots and insects (rarely).&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a href="#fasil">Click Here To Read More About The Castle Of Fasiledes</a><br> They are the only primates that are mainly graminivores (grazer) with grasses constituting 90% of their diet.
They move in troops. At night, they often descend from grazing areas to caves - it’s a wonderful site to watch hundreds of monkeys climbing (and sometimes tumbling) down steep slopes to their night-time spots,<br> which they rest in for safety against predation as well as for warmth. Males, distinguishable by their ‘mane’ of hair, will have a harem of females and these harems often live together, defending against single males. The Gelada has a vocabulary of at least 27 contact calls, an unusually large number.
