		Lalibela (Amharic: ላሊበላ) is a town in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Located in the Lasta district and North Wollo Zone, it is a tourist site for its famous rock-cut monolithic churches. <br>The whole of Lalibela is a large and important site for the antiquity, medieval, and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia.</p>

			Lalibela, historical name Roha, religious and pilgrimage center, north-central Ethiopia. Roha, capital of the Zagwe dynasty for about 300 years, was renamed for its most distinguished monarch, Lalibela, (late 12th–early 13th century), who, according to tradition, built the 11 monolithic churches for which the place is famous.<br> The churches, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1978, were hewn out of solid rock (entirely below ground level) in a variety of styles. Generally, trenches were excavated in a rectangle, isolating a solid granite block. The block was then carved both externally and internally, the work proceeding from the top downward.<br> The churches are arranged in two main groups, connected by subterranean passageways. One group, surrounded by a trench 36 feet (11 meters) deep, includes House of Emmanuel, House of Mercurios, Abba Libanos, and House of Gabriel, all carved from a single rock hill. House of Medhane Alem (“Savior of the World”) is the largest church, 109 feet (33 meters) long, 77 feet (23 meters) wide, and 35 feet (10 meters) deep.<br> House of Giyorgis, cruciform in shape, is carved from a sloping rock terrace. House of Golgotha contains Lalibela’s tomb, and House of Mariam is noted for its frescoes. The interiors were hollowed out into naves and given vaulted ceilings.

			The expert craftsmanship of the Lalibela churches has been linked with the earlier church of Debre Damo near Aksum and tends to support the assumption of a well-developed Ethiopian tradition of architecture.<br> Emperor Lalibela had most of the churches constructed in his capital, Roha, in the hope of replacing ancient Aksum as a city of Ethiopian preeminence.<br> Restoration work in the 20th century indicated that some of the churches may have been used originally as fortifications and royal residences.<br>The churches attract thousands of pilgrims during the major holy day celebrations and are tended by priests of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The town also serves as a market centre for the Amhara people.

			There’s something intensely wonderful and spiritual about Lalibela, a truly amazing town located in the northern region of Ethiopia. This small village is a World Heritage site – acclaimed for its rock-hewn churches, stunning rural landscape, and devout Christianity.<br> If faith is a mystery, there are few places in the Christian world where the mystery is deeper than in Lalibela. King Lalibela is believed to have ordered the building of 11 extraordinary churches at the end of the 11th century and beginning of the 12th. <br>The eleven churches were each carved from a single, gigantic, block of stone. No bricks, no mortar, no concrete, no lumber, just rock sculpted into architecture. Not much is known about who built them, or why. <br>But the faithful of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church say there’s no mystery really. The churches of Lalibela were built by angels!
